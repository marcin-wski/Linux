Sophos AV scan script assumes that you already have Sophos installed beforehand. RootkitCheck and ClamAV scan scripts will install the programs first... but if you are not "user" on your machine, please change that to your actual username so that the script has a place to store the logs

There is no "installation" part in the scripts yet, it's still work in progress
